## Running PostgreSQL with Docker

To set up and run a PostgreSQL instance for the NestJS application, follow these steps:

2. Run the following command in your terminal to start the PostgreSQL container:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ pnpm run start

# watch mode
$ pnpm run start:dev

# production mode
$ pnpm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ pnpm run test

# e2e tests
$ pnpm run test:e2e
